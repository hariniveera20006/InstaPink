# InstaPink
Instapink is an Instagram-like social media platform with a built-in Fake Advertisement Detection System. Users can post, like, comment, and report suspicious ads. A threshold algorithm automatically hides posts when 5 unique users report them. The system improves safety, transparency, and trust using React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
